# DO NOT MODIFY THE COPY OF THIS FILE IN YOUR DEFAULT DIRECTORY
# 	Use it as an example.
#
# This file should be located at $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA_Snort3_json/default/inputs.conf
# copy this file to the local directory and modify that file.
# 
# The new file should be created at $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA_Snort3_json/local/inputs.conf
# 	- only modify this new file.
#
# Reboot Splunk on the server where you modify this file


# Un-comment the below two lines, but modify the first one to point to the location where your Snort 3 alert_json.txt files are stored (/var/log/snort in the example below).  Do not remove the path after the last backslash, since it gives the name of the alert files to collect (to prevent indexing other named files in that directory).

# [monitor:///var/log/snort/*alert_json.txt.*]
# sourcetype = snort3:alert:json


#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Below are option modifications you can consider, depending on your situation, as well as a few different examples.


# Optional modifications
#	- index (if you don't want them in main)

# Example:  Index json log files in the /LOGS directory, and save to the nids-logs index
# [monitor:///LOGS/*alert_json.txt.*]
# sourcetype = snort3:alert:json
# index = nids-logs


# Example: Index json log files in the /home/user/snort/ directory. Save to the NIDS-TEST-INDEX index. Do NOT index any log files that are in sub-folders of the /home/usre/snort directory (in case you've created an 'archive' folder in there that you don't want indexed).

# [monitor:///home/user/snort/*alert_json.txt.*]
# sourcetype = snort3:alert:json
# index = NIDS-TEST-INDEX
# recursive = false
