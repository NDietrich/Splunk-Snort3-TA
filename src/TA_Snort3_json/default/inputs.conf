# SNORT ALERTS
# Un-comment the below two lines, but modify the first one to point to the location where your Snort 3 alert_json.txt files
# are stored (/var/log/snort in the example below).  Do not remove the path after the last backslash, since it gives the 
# name of the alert files to collect (to prevent indexing other named files in that directory).

# [monitor:///var/log/snort/*alert_json.txt*]
# sourcetype = snort3:alert:json

# SNORT OPENAPPID STATISTICS (Optional)
# if you want to collect OpenAppID logs (and have configured the appid_listener plugin),
# uncomment the following two lines and modify the path to point to your log directory).

# [monitor:///var/log/snort/*appid-output.log*]
# sourcetype = snort3:openappid:json


#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Below are optional modifications you can consider, depending on your situation, as well as a few different examples.


# Optional modifications Example
# Index json log files in the /home/user/snort/ directory. Save to the NIDS-TEST-INDEX index. 
# Do NOT index any log files that are in sub-folders of the /home/usre/snort directory using the 'recursive' 
# option (in case you've created an 'archive' folder in there that you don't want indexed).

# [monitor:///home/user/snort/*alert_json.txt*]
# sourcetype = snort3:alert:json
# index = NIDS-TEST-INDEX
# recursive = false
