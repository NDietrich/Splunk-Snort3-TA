Technology Add-On for Snort3 Json Alerts
========================================

Overview
-----------

The Snort 3 for JSON Alerts Technology Add-On (TA_Snort3_json) is a Splunk Technology Add-On written by Noah Dietrich for ingesting and normalizing alert data created by a Snort 3 IDS in JSON format.

This Technology Add-On (TA) normalizes Snort 3 alerts that are written with Snort 3's alert_json plugin to make it compliant with the "Network Intrusion Detection" model of the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM).

The public repository for this TA is: https://github.com/NDietrich/Splunk-Snort3-TA.

IMPORTANT
---------

Snort 3 is currently a Beta product. It should not be used in production or mission-cricical environments, and is available primarily for testing purposes.  Because of this, it is possible that future modifications to Snort 3 will break this plugin. This plugin has been released before the final version of Snort 3 has been finalized to solicit feedback, including feature requests and bug reports.

Installation & Configuration
----------------------------

More detailed configuration instructions for Snort 3 can be found at https://SublimeRobots.com/.

Configuring Snort 3 json_alerts Output Plugin
---------------------------------------------
Ensure that you have installed Snort 3, and it is correctly outputting alerts in JSON format.  Please see https://snort.org/documents for installation guides (make sure to install Snort 3 instead of Snort 2).  If you are unsure what platform to install Snort on (Linux, Windows, BSD), choose the platform you are most comfortable using.  I have authored some in-depth installation guides for Ubuntu, available on Snort's website, or alternately available at https://SublimeRobots.com/.

In your json output files, make sure that 'seconds' field is the very first field output for each alert.  The alert_json plugin is configured in the snort.lua file.  In the example below, you can see the following output options:

- fields:  The 'seconds' field is the first field listed (and thus the first field in the output).  The example here is outputting every possible field.  You can probably remove some of these fields after testing to determine if they are necessary, such as the vlan or mpls fields.
- file"  We are o utputting to a file (the alert_json.txt file).
- limit: Each json file will be 100 MB before it rolls over to a new file (named alert_json.txt.*epochtime*).

```
--- in your snort.lua file
alert_json =
{
    fields = 'seconds timestamp action class b64_data dir dst_addr dst_ap dst_port eth_dst eth_len eth_src eth_type gid icmp_code icmp_id icmp_seq icmp_type iface ip_id ip_len msg mpls pkt_gen pkt_len pkt_num priority proto rev rule service sid src_addr src_ap src_port target tcp_ack tcp_flags tcp_len tcp_seq tcp_win tos ttl udp_len vlan',
    file = true,
    limit = 100,
}
```

Installation of this TA
-----------------------
This TA should be installed on all servers in your infrastructure, but most important it must be installed and configured on the server where the log files are ingested.  Failure to also install this plugin on Indexers, Heavy forwarders, or Search Heads may result in data that is not normalized correctly.

Configuration of this TA
------------------------
The TA must be configured wherever Snort 3 JSON logs are collected (usually on your UF).  You do not need to modify this TA on any Splunk servers that are not actively collecting logs (you don't need to modify this TA on your indexers or search heads, it just needs to be installed for CIM normalization).

On the Splunk servers where you will be collecting log files, you must modify this plugin to specify the location of your Snort 3 JSON files.  This can be accomplished by creating a new 'inputs.conf' file in the TA_Snort3_json application 'local' folder. Do not modify the ./default/inputs.conf file directly.

Create a new ./local/inputs.conf file in the TA_Snort3_json folder. This file should be located at:
  $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA_Snort3_json/local/inputs.conf

You must place a 'monitor' stanza in the local inputs.conf file that contains the path to the folder containing the Snort 3 alert JSON files. For example, if your files are located in /var/log/snort (a common location), your ./local/inputs.conf file should contain the following two lines:

    [monitor:///var/log/snort/*alert_json.txt*]
    sourcetype = snort3:alert:json

These lines are required, and will allow Splunk to index all Snort 3 json alert log files in the /var/log/snort folder (and sub-folders).

Restart Splunk on the server where you created this inputs.conf file. Splunk will index existing Snort 3 json files in this folder and sub-folders.


Optional Input Configuration Options
-------------------------------------

The following settings for you local inputs.conf file are available if you have specific needs.  For example, if you want to save these events to a different index, add the following line specifying the index name:

	# in your $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA_Snort3_json/local/inputs.conf file
	[monitor:///var/log/snort/*alert_json.txt*]
	sourcetype = snort3:alert:json
	index = another-index-name

If you do not want to monitor sub-folders of the initial folder (say if you're rotating logs to a sub-folder), you can disable recursion:

	# in your $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA_Snort3_json/local/inputs.conf file
	[monitor:///var/log/snort/*alert_json.txt*]
	sourcetype = snort3:alert:json
	recursive = false


Searching Snort 3 events:
------------------------- 

Once your indexer is collecting Snort 3 events, you can search for them simply by searching by sourcetype:

	search sourcetype=snort3:alert:json

you can also use the following tags (this could return normalized events from other NIDS's if you have them):

	search tag=ids AND tag=attack


Recommended supporting Add-ons:
------------------------------

* Decrypt:  https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2655
This TA provides the ability to convert the packet data (stored in the b64_data field) into readable info.  in the example below, the 2nd line takes advantage of this new TA to display the URI data from web reqests:
```

    sourcetype=snort3:alert:json b64_data = * dst_port=80
    | decrypt field=b64_data atob emit('decrypted')
    | table gid, sid, priority, class, msg, decrypted
```

This becomes very helpful when looking at the contents of alerts containing URIs, SMTP and FTP data, web URI's, and shell code.


Additional Notes:
-----------------

The b64_data data field is responsible for most of the data created by the plugin. If you are worried about Splunk license usage, and don't need the packet data, then you can omit this field in the alert_json Snort configuration file snort.lua.  In my testing, I have found that 10 MB of log data with all fields enabled (including the b64_data field) contains approximately 10,000 events, while removing the b64_data field fit 15,000 events in 10 MB.
